  <h1 style="text-align: center;">History</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">With 25 aircraft in operation, 52 pilots on staff and more than 250 employees in peak season,
       Kenmore Air is among the best-known and most respected seaplane operations in the world.<br>
       We fly an eclectic mix of piston de Havilland Beavers and turbine de Havilland Otters and Cessna Caravans, 
       landing passengers on lakes, harbors, and tarmac among the mist-shrouded fjords and islands of the US and Canadian northwest.</p>

      <div class="avia_textblock" itemprop="text"><h2 style="text-align: center;">Kenmore Air: 1996 – Today</h2>
        <p>If Kenmore Air’s business took off from 1971 to 1996, the next chapter is when it came in for a landing. Literally.</p>
        <p>In June 2004, Kenmore Air inaugurated landplane service, leasing one Cessna Caravan that flew the route to Port Angeles.<br>
        This marked a significant step, providing all-weather service for both day and night commuters. 
        The service was also less seasonal.</p>
        <p>By July 2008, the landplane division christened Kenmore Air Express, was flying 60,000 passengers per year.</p>
        <p>It was the next path in a path that Bob Munro had started back in 1946 when he and two men he knew in high school
           were working on <br>a salvaged floatplane in a single garage.</p>
        <p>Munro, who’d graduated from Seattle’s Roosevelt High School in 1935, married Ruth Holden in 1942, and they had raised 
          a family there <br>in Kenmore in a house located on the 5-acre campus that is Kenmore Air Harbor.</p>
        <p>In 1997, he was inducted into the Pathfinder Hall of Fame at the Museum of Flight. </p>
         <p> In 1999, he was inducted into the Washington State Aeronautics Hall of Fame.</p>
        <p>Bob Munro died in October 2000, and while he stopped flying in the 1980s, he never retired, working at Kenmore Air throughout 
        those 54 years.<br> After he passed there was some question about what would happen with the business going forward. Wait. 
        That’s not quite right. Some people had questions, but Gregg Munro and Leslie Banks,<br> the children of Bob and Ruth Munro,
         kept the business open.</p>
        <p>Gregg had worked his way up the business from flight operations manager in 1980 and later became president. 
          Leslie Banks, Bob’s daughter, was working from her early teenage years and <br>eventually managed the office, and her son Todd 
          — Bob’s grandson — computerized the flight operations and upgraded the parts department computers as well.</p>
        <p>Todd now serves as president while his son Hunter has started — as all members of the family do — with the entry-level 
          duties like emptying the garbage, washing planes, and working the lines.</p>
        <p>Family runs deep at Kenmore Air. Clarence Rader started with Kenmore in 1946, and his son, Jerry, was later the company’s
           technical adviser while Steven, the grandson of Clarence, became a mechanic.</p>
        <p>The business that Bob started would be guided by the next two generations of his family as it solidified itself not just as a
           business, but as a critical cog in the region’s transportation network.<br> A critical cog that was also the coolest,
            now flying regular schedules as opposed to orienting itself around the charter business.</p>
        <p>By 2010, 90 percent of Kenmore Air’s flights were scheduled, and a family-owned business that is more than 75 years old and 
          in its fourth generation is still operating by the words of its founder,<br>
          Bob Munro: “As long as we have the kind of people working for us that we’ve had since the beginning, 
           there should be airplanes with ‘Kenmore’ on the side flying around this part of the world for a long time.”</p>
